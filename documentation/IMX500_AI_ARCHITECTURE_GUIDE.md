# IMX500 AI Architecture Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of the IMX500 AI-enabled architecture that leverages Sony's on-chip AI processing for real-time vehicle detection with sub-100ms inference and zero CPU usage.

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Previous Architecture Issues:**
- ❌ Software-based vehicle detection in Docker containers (seconds, high CPU)
- ❌ Wasted IMX500's on-chip AI processing capabilities
- ❌ `rpicam-still` command-line capture without AI integration
- ❌ No real-time inference - post-processing only

**New Architecture Benefits:**
- ✅ **Sub-100ms inference** directly on IMX500 sensor chip
- ✅ **Zero CPU usage** for AI processing (dedicated neural processor)
- ✅ **Real-time object detection** with 4K image capture
- ✅ **Efficient data flow**: IMX500 → Redis → Docker containers
- ✅ **Hybrid processing**: On-chip AI for vehicles, Docker for sky analysis

## 🏗️ Architecture Comparison

### Before: Software-Based Processing
```
Camera → rpicam-still → Shared Volume → Docker → Software AI → Results
                                      ↑ 
                                  High CPU usage
                                  Seconds latency
                                  Wasted IMX500 AI chip
```

### After: IMX500 On-Chip AI Processing
```
IMX500 Sensor → On-Chip AI (Vehicle Detection) → Host Python Service → Redis → Docker
     ↑                    ↑                           ↑                    ↑
4K Images          Sub-100ms inference        Data consolidation    Sky analysis only
                   Zero CPU usage             Real-time publishing   Non-AI tasks

## 🚀 Implementation Components

### 1. IMX500 AI Host Service (`imx500_ai_host_capture.py`)

**Purpose:** Leverages IMX500's on-chip AI for real-time vehicle detection

**Key Features:**
- Uses `picamera2` with IMX500 AI integration
- Loads SSD MobileNetV2 model onto sensor chip
- Captures 4K images with simultaneous AI inference
- Publishes results to Redis for Docker consumption
- Zero software-based AI processing

**Performance:**
- **Inference Time:** <100ms (on-chip)
- **CPU Usage:** ~0% for AI (dedicated chip)
- **Image Quality:** 4056x3040 @ 95% JPEG quality
- **Detection Accuracy:** SSD MobileNetV2 with 50% confidence threshold

### 2. Vehicle Consolidator Service (`vehicle_consolidator_service.py`)

**Purpose:** Aggregates vehicle detection data from IMX500 host service

**Key Features:**
- Consumes IMX500 AI results from Redis
- Aggregates statistics and patterns
- Handles data persistence and cleanup  
- Zero AI processing (leverages IMX500 results)

**Replaces:** Software-based vehicle detection in Docker containers

### 3. Deployment Infrastructure

**Systemd Service:** `imx500-ai-capture.service`
- Manages IMX500 host service lifecycle
- Automatic restart and error recovery
- Proper hardware access permissions

**Deployment Script:** `deploy-imx500-ai-service.sh`
- Validates system requirements
- Installs and configures service
- Health checks and monitoring setup

## 🔧 Installation & Deployment

### Prerequisites

1. **Raspberry Pi 5** with IMX500 AI Camera
2. **IMX500 Firmware:** `sudo apt install imx500-all`
3. **Python Dependencies:** `picamera2`, `redis-py`
4. **AI Model:** SSD MobileNetV2 (included with imx500-all)

### Deployment Steps

1. **Deploy New IMX500 Service:**
   ```bash
   sudo ./deployment/deploy-imx500-ai-service.sh
   ```

2. **Update Docker Containers:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Verify Operation:**
   ```bash
   # Check IMX500 service
   sudo systemctl status imx500-ai-capture
   
   # Monitor logs
   sudo journalctl -u imx500-ai-capture -f
   
   # Check Redis data
   redis-cli keys 'vehicle:detection:*'
   
   # Check Docker services
   docker-compose ps
   ```

## 🔄 Data Flow

### Vehicle Detection Flow
```
1. IMX500 Sensor captures 4K image
2. On-chip AI processor runs SSD MobileNetV2 model
3. Sensor outputs both image + AI detection results
4. Host Python service receives both outputs
5. Service publishes vehicle detections to Redis
6. Docker consolidator consumes and aggregates data
7. API endpoints serve historical vehicle data
```

### Sky Analysis Flow (Unchanged)
```
1. IMX500 captures 4K image (AI results ignored for sky)
2. Host service saves image to shared volume
3. Docker sky analysis service processes image
4. Results stored in Redis and served via API
```

## 🐞 Monitoring & Troubleshooting

### Health Checks

**IMX500 Host Service:**
```bash
sudo systemctl status imx500-ai-capture
sudo journalctl -u imx500-ai-capture -n 50
```

**Redis Data Verification:**
```bash
redis-cli keys 'vehicle:detection:*' | head -5
redis-cli get 'stats:realtime:vehicles'
```

**Docker Container Health:**
```bash
docker-compose ps
docker logs vehicle-consolidator
```

### Common Issues

**1. IMX500 Model Not Found**
```bash
sudo apt install imx500-all
ls -la /usr/share/imx500-models/
```

**2. Permission Errors**
```bash
sudo usermod -a -G video merk
sudo chmod 666 /dev/video* /dev/media*
```

**3. Redis Connection Issues**
```bash
redis-cli ping
docker logs redis
```
