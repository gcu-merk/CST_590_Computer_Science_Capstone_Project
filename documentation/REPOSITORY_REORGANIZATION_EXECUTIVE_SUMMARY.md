# Repository Reorganization - Executive Summary

**Project:** CST 590 Capstone Repository Restructuring  
**Date:** September 27, 2025  
**Status:** Proposal Phase  

## Quick Overview

This proposal addresses the current repository's organizational challenges by implementing a modern, industry-standard directory structure that separates concerns and improves maintainability.

## Current Problems

- **Scattered Files**: 40+ configuration and documentation files in root directory
- **Mixed Concerns**: Source code, configs, docs, and deployment scripts intermixed
- **Inconsistent Naming**: Mix of snake_case, kebab-case, and PascalCase
- **Testing Issues**: Tests buried in scripts folder without proper organization
- **Docker Sprawl**: 7+ Dockerfile variants without clear structure

## Proposed Solution

### New Structure
```
├── src/                    # All source code
├── config/                 # Configuration management  
├── deployment/             # Deployment & infrastructure
├── docs/                   # Consolidated documentation
├── tests/                  # Proper testing structure
├── tools/                  # Development utilities
├── data/                   # Sample data & fixtures
└── scripts/                # Current utility scripts (preserved)
```

## Benefits Summary

| Aspect | Current State | Proposed Improvement |
|--------|---------------|---------------------|
| **File Discovery** | 2+ hours for new developers | 30 minutes orientation |
| **Code Organization** | Scattered, unclear structure | Logical, industry-standard |
| **Testing** | Buried in scripts folder | Dedicated test hierarchy |
| **Deployment** | Mixed with source code | Dedicated deployment structure |
| **Documentation** | 20+ files in root + docs folder | Organized in logical categories |

## Implementation Phases

1. **Phase 1** (1-2 days): Documentation & Configuration - **Low Risk**
2. **Phase 2** (2-3 days): Non-Critical Source Code - **Medium Risk**  
3. **Phase 3** (3-5 days): Core Services & APIs - **High Risk**
4. **Phase 4** (2-3 days): Testing Infrastructure - **Medium Risk**
5. **Phase 5** (2-4 days): Deployment & Tools - **High Risk**

**Total Estimated Time:** 10-17 days

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas
- **Service Disruption**: Phased migration with rollback plans
- **Import Failures**: Automated import scanning and updates  
- **Docker Issues**: Build context validation and testing

### Safety Measures
- Full repository backup before starting
- Symlink strategy for critical services during transition
- Comprehensive testing in isolated environment
- Emergency rollback procedures documented

## Success Criteria

- **Zero Downtime**: No service interruption during migration
- **100% Test Pass Rate**: All tests working post-migration
- **Improved Developer Velocity**: Faster file discovery and feature development
- **Reduced Configuration Errors**: Better organized deployment configs

## Next Steps

1. **Stakeholder Review**: Development and operations team approval
2. **Detailed Planning**: Finalize migration scripts and procedures  
3. **Test Environment Setup**: Validate changes in isolated environment
4. **Implementation**: Execute phased migration plan
5. **Post-Migration Validation**: Comprehensive testing and monitoring

## Recommendation

**Proceed with reorganization** using the phased approach to minimize risk while achieving significant long-term benefits for project maintainability and developer productivity.
