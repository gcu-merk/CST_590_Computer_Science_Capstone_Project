Advancements in affordable and accessible technology, such as the Raspberry Pi, offer new possibilities for developing cost-effective solutions for various applications, including traffic speed monitoring. Research has demonstrated the versatility of the Raspberry Pi in powering numerous DIY projects and proof-of-concept developments. This low-cost, credit-card-sized computer has gained popularity for its potential to drive innovative solutions in various fields, including traffic management (Khan et al., 2022).

Communities are increasingly seeking innovative ways to enhance road safety without imposing significant financial burdens. Literature suggests that affordable, DIY solutions leveraging open-source technology and readily available components can empower local governments and community groups to proactively address speeding issues (Kohler, 2022).

This project, named "Pi Safe Street," aims to develop and test a proof-of-concept for a cost-effective residential traffic speed monitoring system using Raspberry Pi. By prioritizing affordability, ease of implementation, and effectiveness, this project seeks to address the gap in accessible traffic monitoring solutions and contribute to safer residential environments. The success of this proof-of-concept could serve as a model for other communities, enabling the widespread adoption of affordable road safety solutions.

This study aims to answer critical research questions that address the accuracy, cost-effectiveness, reliability, and community impact of using a Raspberry Pi-based traffic speed detection system in residential areas. By exploring these questions, we can validate the feasibility of implementing low-cost, DIY solutions for enhancing road safety.

### Traditional Traffic Speed Monitoring Systems

Traditional traffic speed monitoring systems, while effective, often come with excessive costs that make them inaccessible to many communities. Fixed speed cameras, radar speed guns, lidar systems, inductive loop sensors, and ANPR (Automatic Number Plate Recognition) systems are some common methods used to monitor traffic speed. Fixed speed cameras are installed at specific locations to capture images of speeding vehicles and issue fines automatically. While they provide legal evidence for enforcement, they are expensive to install and maintain and are limited to fixed locations. Radar speed guns, which law enforcement officers use to measure vehicle speed using radar waves, offer portability and immediate feedback but require manual operation and cover a limited area. Lidar systems use laser beams to measure vehicle speed and distance accurately but are costly and require manual operation. Inductive loop sensors, embedded in the roadway to detect vehicle speed and count by measuring changes in inductance as vehicles pass over, are durable and reliable but have high installation costs and are disruptive to install. ANPR systems capture and analyze vehicle license plates to calculate speed over a known distance, providing continuous monitoring but requiring extensive infrastructure and raising privacy concerns.

The high initial costs of equipment and installation, along with ongoing maintenance expenses and the need for technical expertise, make traditional traffic speed monitoring systems financially challenging for many communities. Additionally, these systems are often limited to specific locations, may require significant resources for manual operation, and can be vulnerable to vandalism and environmental factors. These limitations highlight the need for more affordable and accessible alternatives, such as the Raspberry Pi-based traffic speed detection system proposed in the "Pi Safe Street" project. This project aims to provide a practical, low-cost solution to enhance road safety in residential neighborhoods by leveraging modern, accessible technology.

### Environment and Tools

![System Architecture Diagram](Image 1)

The traffic monitoring system architecture (Image 1) follows a clear data flow from vehicle detection to end user visualization through four integrated layers. The physical foundation consists of sensors and hardware including an AI Camera with Sony IMX500 sensor that captures vehicle images, a Doppler Radar (OPS243-C) that measures vehicle speeds, a Raspberry Pi 5 that processes all sensor data, and environmental housing with connectivity infrastructure to ensure reliable operation in outdoor conditions.

The captured sensor data flows into the real-time data processing and AI analysis layer, where computer vision algorithms using OpenCV and TensorFlow with YOLOv8 perform vehicle detection on camera feeds. Simultaneously, signal processing components built with NumPy and SciPy analyze radar data for speed calculations. A data fusion engine combines information from both camera and radar sensors, while an analytics engine generates comprehensive traffic metrics. Weather API integration provides environmental correlation to enhance the accuracy and context of traffic analysis.

Processed data is then managed through a comprehensive storage system that includes SQLite databases for local event storage, HDF5 files optimized for time series data, traditional file systems for configuration and log management, external SSD drives for archive storage, and optional cloud storage for backup and remote access. This multi-tiered storage approach ensures data integrity, performance, and scalability based on different data types and access patterns.

The final layer provides user access through a web interface built on Flask server architecture that offers REST API endpoints, SocketIO implementation for real-time dashboard updates, web-based dashboards featuring charts and visualizations, dedicated API endpoints for data export functionality, and external access capabilities supporting mobile applications and third-party system integration. The happy path begins with vehicle detection as sensors capture vehicle presence and speed data, continues through data processing where AI algorithms analyze and correlate sensor information, proceeds to data storage where processed information is archived in multiple formats, and culminates in user interface access where end users view real-time and historical data through web dashboards. This comprehensive system serves diverse user groups including traffic managers who monitor real-time conditions, city planners who analyze traffic patterns for infrastructure decisions, law enforcement personnel who track violations and incidents, and researchers who study traffic behavior and trends, with each group accessing tailored data views through the unified web interface.

### Algorithm and Data

![Algorithm Diagram](Image 2)

![Data Flow Diagram](Image 3)

The traffic monitoring system processes multiple data streams through sophisticated algorithms and modern technologies to provide real-time traffic analysis and management capabilities. The system begins by collecting input data from four primary sources: camera feeds using AI-enabled Sony IMX500 cameras that capture vehicle images, radar data from OPS243-C Doppler radar sensors providing precise speed and occupancy measurements, Weather API integration monitoring temperature, humidity, precipitation, and visibility conditions, and internal system state information tracking network health and activation status through SNMP protocols running on Raspberry Pi 5 processing units are housed in environmental protection enclosures with robust connectivity infrastructure.

The collected data flows through two parallel processing pipelines that handle diverse types of sensor inputs using innovative technologies. The computer vision pipeline processes camera feeds through a series of stages including preprocessing using OpenCV libraries for noise reduction and camera calibration, YOLOv8 deep convolutional neural network implemented with TensorFlow for high-accuracy vehicle detection to identify vehicles and pedestrians, feature extraction using computer vision algorithms like HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) or CNN-based feature extractors to capture distinctive characteristics, and multi-object tracking employing algorithms like DeepSORT or ByteTrack to maintain consistent vehicle identification across frames. Simultaneously, the radar signal processing pipeline conditions incoming radar signals using NumPy and SciPy digital signal processing libraries, performs FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) analysis implemented through optimized mathematical libraries for frequency domain conversion, and calculates speed measurements with temporal filtering using moving average filters and outlier detection algorithms to ensure accuracy.

The processed data from both pipelines converges in a multi-sensor data fusion layer powered by advanced algorithms that represent the system's core intelligence. This fusion process involves spatial alignment using coordinate transformation matrices, temporal synchronization through Network Time Protocol (NTP) and timestamp correlation to ensure time-consistent measurements, data association using Hungarian algorithm or Joint Probabilistic Data Association (JPDA) to link observations from multiple sensors to the same vehicles, Kalman filtering (including Extended Kalman Filter variants) for optimal state estimation and noise reduction, track management using track-to-track fusion algorithms to maintain vehicle trajectories, validation through chi-squared tests and Mahalanobis distance calculations to ensure data quality, and event generation using rule-based engines and complex event processing (CEP) frameworks to trigger alerts or responses based on detected conditions.

The fused and validated data then feeds into a comprehensive traffic analytics and machine learning engine powered by the integrated Analytics Engine that performs statistical analysis of traffic flow patterns using descriptive and inferential statistics, time series analysis for trend identification through seasonal decomposition and autocorrelation analysis, pattern recognition using clustering algorithms like K-means and classification models to identify traffic behaviors, predictive modeling using LSTM networks, Random Forest, or Support Vector Machines for forecasting future conditions, performance metrics calculation through KPI dashboards, and automated reporting capabilities.

Finally, the system outputs processed information through multiple channels leveraging modern data infrastructure technologies including real-time data streams using SocketIO for immediate web-based updates, local event storage using SQLite databases for transactional data, time series data stores using HDF5 format optimized for numerical data analysis and trend tracking, file system storage for configuration files and system logs, external SSD storage for data archiving with optional cloud backup integration, RESTful API responses built with Flask framework providing endpoints for external system integration, web-based visualization dashboards using real-time charts and analytics interfaces accessible to traffic managers, city planners, law enforcement, and researchers, and alert systems using notification services integrated through the web interface for immediate notification of significant events or anomalies to traffic management personnel and stakeholders.
