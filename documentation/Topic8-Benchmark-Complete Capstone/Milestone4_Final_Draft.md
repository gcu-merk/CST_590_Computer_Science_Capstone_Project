- API: `curl https://localhost:8443/health`
- Redis: `docker exec redis-db redis-cli PING`
- Database: `sqlite3 /mnt/storage/data/traffic_data.db "PRAGMA integrity_check;"`

### Backup and Recovery

**Database Backup:**
```bash
# Create SQLite backup
sqlite3 /mnt/storage/data/traffic_data.db ".backup /backup/traffic_data_$(date +%Y%m%d).db"
```

**Configuration Backup:**
```bash
# Backup Docker Compose files
tar -czf config_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz docker-compose*.yml config/
```

**Recovery Procedures:**
- Documented rollback procedures (3-minute process)
- Git-based version control for all code
- Database restoration from backups
- Service restart procedures

### Security Management

**HTTPS/TLS Configuration:**
- Self-signed certificate for edge dashboard
- TLS 1.2+ only (strong cipher suites)
- Certificate renewal procedures

**VPN Access (Tailscale):**
- Device authentication via Tailscale admin console
- MagicDNS hostname: `edge-traffic-monitoring.taild46447.ts.net`
- Peer-to-peer WireGuard encryption

**Firewall Rules (UFW):**
```bash
# Allow HTTPS
sudo ufw allow 8443/tcp

# Allow Tailscale
sudo ufw allow 41641/udp

# Deny all other inbound
sudo ufw default deny incoming
```
