Recommendations:
1. AI Camera Configuration & Optimization
Picamera2 Performance Tweaks: If encountering latency, adjust the frame buffer settings to optimize efficiency.

Threaded Processing: Use concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor or multiprocessing to parallelize detection and avoid blocking calls in TensorFlow/OpenCV.

2. Radar Sensor Integration
UART Optimization: The OPS243-C radar sensor operates over serial communication. Ensure that:

The pyserial library is properly configured.

Baud rate settings match the radar module’s defaults.

Implement exception handling to catch communication failures.

3. Data Fusion Strategy
Since you’re combining AI-based visual detection with radar data, consider:

Kalman Filtering: Helps smooth data from different sources and correct inconsistencies.

Timestamp Synchronization: Align radar and camera timestamps for reliable matching.

4. Flask API Server Enhancements
Asynchronous API Handling: Use Flask-SocketIO to stream real-time detection results instead of polling endpoints.

Edge Web Interface: A lightweight dashboard (HTML/CSS/JS) hosted locally on the Pi can help with debugging.

5. Cloud Strategy (if needed later)
MQTT: If sending minimal processed data, MQTT can be a lightweight option instead of full API requests.

AWS Lambda + DynamoDB: A cost-effective approach if real-time cloud storage is required.
