can this all be completed in 8 weeks with the use of AI coding tools?Edit2 / 2Realistically? Probably not all of it in 8 weeks, but you could get a solid MVP running. Here's the honest breakdown:
What AI Coding Tools Excel At (Weeks 1-4)

Basic integrations: Camera setup, radar UART communication, database schema
Standard API endpoints: Flask routes, WebSocket handlers, basic CRUD operations
Configuration management: Docker setup, systemd services, logging
Simple algorithms: Basic object detection pipeline, data storage/retrieval

Where AI Tools Struggle (Weeks 5-8+)

Real-time performance optimization: Memory management, threading, hardware-specific tuning
Complex sensor fusion: Kalman filter tuning, multi-object tracking correlation
Hardware-specific debugging: GPIO issues, camera driver problems, timing constraints
Domain expertise: Traffic monitoring best practices, false positive reduction

8-Week Reality Check
✅ Achievable in 8 weeks:

Basic vehicle detection using IMX500
Simple speed logging from radar
SQLite data storage
Basic REST API
Docker containerization
Simple web dashboard

❌ Challenging in 8 weeks:

Robust multi-object tracking
Accurate camera-radar fusion
Performance optimization for 24/7 operation
Production-ready error handling
Comprehensive testing

Recommended 8-Week Strategy
Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2): Get basic detection working
Phase 2 (Weeks 3-4): Add radar integration and simple correlation
Phase 3 (Weeks 5-6): Build web interface and API
Phase 4 (Weeks 7-8): Integration testing and basic optimization
Result: You'd have a working system that detects vehicles and logs speeds, but the advanced AI/ML features would need additional iterations.
AI coding tools will definitely accelerate development, but the complex algorithmic work and hardware integration will still require significant hands-on problem-solving time.
