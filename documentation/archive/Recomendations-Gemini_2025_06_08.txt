Based on your detailed project summary, your plan is solid, well-structured, and technically sound. The use of a Raspberry Pi 5 with an AI camera and a dedicated radar sensor for an edge ML application is a robust approach. Here are a few recommendations to consider as you move into the next phases of your project.

Recommendations
1. Software and Performance Optimization
Consider a dedicated inference engine. While the full TensorFlow library will run on the Raspberry Pi 5, you might achieve significant performance gains by using an optimized inference engine like TensorFlow Lite or the ONNX Runtime. These are specifically designed for edge devices and can offer lower latency and a smaller memory footprint, even with 16GB of RAM. This could become crucial if you decide to run more complex models or multiple services simultaneously in the future.
Optimize your TensorFlow model. Before deploying, ensure your model is as efficient as possible. Techniques like quantization (converting model weights from 32-bit floating-point numbers to 8-bit integers) can dramatically improve inference speed on ARM CPUs with minimal impact on accuracy.
2. Sensor Integration and Data Fusion
Time synchronization is key. When combining data from the camera and the radar, ensure your data points are accurately timestamped. A slight delay between a vehicle being detected by the camera and its speed being measured by the radar could lead to incorrect data association. Implementing the Network Time Protocol (NTP) on the Raspberry Pi will ensure a consistent time source.
Develop a robust data fusion algorithm. Your current plan is to combine visual detection with radar speed. Consider the logic for associating a specific radar speed reading with a specific vehicle detected by the camera, especially in multi-lane traffic scenarios. You may need to develop a simple tracking algorithm that assigns a unique ID to each detected vehicle as it passes through the frame, then associates the radar's speed reading with that tracked object.
3. System Reliability and Management
Implement a watchdog timer. To ensure your system runs continuously without manual intervention, consider implementing a watchdog timer. This can be a hardware or software mechanism that automatically reboots the Raspberry Pi if it becomes unresponsive. This is a common practice for remote or unattended edge devices.
Consider containerization with Docker. For easier deployment, dependency management, and scalability, you might want to containerize your services (vehicle detection, speed analysis, Flask API) using Docker. This will make your application more portable and easier to manage, especially if you plan to deploy this system on multiple devices.
4. Data Management and Storage
Use a more robust storage solution than writing directly to the MicroSD card. Continuously writing data to a MicroSD card can cause it to wear out over time. For logging and temporary data storage, consider mounting a small in-memory filesystem (like tmpfs) to minimize writes to the SD card. For more permanent local storage, an external USB SSD would be a more durable and faster option.
Implement a data offloading strategy. Since the device is designed to be "offline-first," have a clear strategy for what happens when the local storage fills up or when the internet connection is restored after an outage. This could involve data compression, prioritization of data to be sent, and deletion of older, less critical data from the local device.
Overall, your project is on an excellent track. These recommendations are intended to enhance the robustness, performance, and long-term reliability of your traffic monitoring system.
