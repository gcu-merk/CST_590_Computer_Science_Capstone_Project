## Development Strategy with VS Code + GitHub Copilot

### Leveraging AI-Assisted Development
**Code Generation:** Use Copilot for boilerplate code, algorithm implementations, and optimization suggestions
**Documentation:** Generate comprehensive code comments and documentation templates
**Testing:** Create unit tests and validation scripts with AI assistance
**Debugging:** Utilize Copilot for error diagnosis and solution suggestions

### Version Control Strategy
**Branch Management:**
- `main`: Stable releases only
- `phase1-dev`: Phase 1 development
- `phase2-dev`: Phase 2 development (if reached)
- `testing`: Integration testing branch

**Commit Strategy:**
- Daily commits with clear, descriptive messages
- Feature-based commits for major functionality
- Tag releases at end of each week for milestone tracking

### Risk Mitigation Strategies

**Technical Risks:**
- Maintain working Phase 1 system as fallback
- Regular integration testing to catch issues early
- Performance monitoring to prevent resource bottlenecks
- Modular design allows feature rollback if needed

**Timeline Risks:**
- Phase 2 is explicitly optional based on Phase 1 completion
- Week 5 checkpoint determines Phase 2 feasibility
- Buffer time in Weeks 7-8 for unexpected issues
- Clear success criteria prevent scope creep

**Quality Risks:**
- Continuous testing throughout development
- Code reviews (even if self-review with AI assistance)
- Documentation concurrent with development
- Regular backup and version control

This revised timeline aligns your development strategy with realistic expectations while maintaining ambitious goals. The hardware validation foundation and AI-assisted development tools significantly improve your success probability for both Phase 1 completion and potential Phase 2 achievement.
