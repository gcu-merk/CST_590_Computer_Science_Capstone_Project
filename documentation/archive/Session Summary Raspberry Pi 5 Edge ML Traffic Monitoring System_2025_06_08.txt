# Session Summary: Raspberry Pi 5 Edge ML Traffic Monitoring System

## Project Overview
Setting up an edge ML system for traffic monitoring that processes video locally on Raspberry Pi 5 and sends only processed results to cloud services for aggregation and reporting.

## Hardware Configuration
- **Raspberry Pi 5 16GB** with 2.4GHz quad-core ARM Cortex-A76 CPU
- **256GB Samsung MicroSD** card
- **Raspberry Pi AI Camera** (Sony IMX500 sensor with integrated AI processing)
- **OmniPreSense OPS243-C FMCW Doppler Radar Sensor** for accurate speed detection

## Architecture Decided
**Local Edge Processing (Pi 5):**
- Vehicle Detection Service (TensorFlow + OpenCV from AI Camera)
- Speed Analysis Service (OPS243-C radar sensor for precise speed measurements)
- Edge API Gateway (Flask server)

**Cloud Services (Simplified):**
- Data Aggregation Service (receives processed results only)
- Dashboard/Reporting Service
- Alert Service

## Current Setup Status

### ‚úÖ Completed
1. **Python Environment**: Virtual environment created at `~/traffic-monitor/venv`
2. **Core Dependencies Installed**:
   - TensorFlow 2.19.0 
   - OpenCV 4.11.0
   - NumPy 2.1.3
   - Flask
3. **Code Artifacts Created**:
   - Vehicle detection service with TensorFlow/OpenCV integration
   - AI Camera management system
   - Test suite for validation

### üîÑ In Progress
1. **AI Camera Setup**: System packages installation and picamera2 integration
2. **Testing Phase**: Validating camera access and detection pipeline

### ‚è≥ Next Steps
1. Complete AI Camera configuration and testing
2. Integrate OPS243-C radar sensor for speed detection (UART/Serial communication)
3. Combine camera vehicle detection with radar speed measurements
4. Create Flask API server for local services
5. Set up cloud integration (optional, can use free tiers)
6. Deploy and test full system

## Key Technical Decisions
- Using full TensorFlow instead of TensorFlow Lite (16GB RAM can handle it)
- Virtual environment approach due to externally-managed Python environment
- AI Camera integration with picamera2 library
- **OPS243-C radar for accurate speed detection** (replacing pixel-based speed calculation)
- Background subtraction fallback if ML models fail
- Local processing first, cloud integration optional

## Sensor Integration Strategy
- **AI Camera**: Vehicle detection and classification
- **OPS243-C Radar**: Precise speed measurements via Doppler effect
- **Data Fusion**: Combine visual detection with radar speed data for comprehensive traffic analysis

## Files Created
- `~/traffic-monitor/` - Main project directory
- Vehicle detection service code (needs radar integration)
- AI Camera setup script
- Comprehensive test suite

## No Subscription Costs Yet
- Running entirely on free/open-source software
- Cloud integration can start with free tiers (AWS/GCP)
- Total hardware cost: ~$200-250 (one-time, including radar sensor)

The system is designed to work offline-first with optional cloud connectivity for remote monitoring and data aggregation. The combination of AI camera and radar sensor provides both visual vehicle identification and precise speed measurements.
