## **High-Level System Architecture Overview**  

### **Architecture Layers**  

#### **Layer 1: Physical Sensing Layer**  
**Hardware Components:**  
- Raspberry Pi AI Camera (Sony IMX500 sensor)  
- OPS243-C FMCW Doppler Radar Sensor  
- Raspberry Pi 5 (16GB RAM, ARM Cortex-A76 CPU)  
- External USB SSD (Samsung T7 or SanDisk Extreme Pro)  
- Power & Connectivity (PoE, WiFi/Ethernet, optional cellular backup)  

**Responsibilities:**  
- Physical vehicle detection and classification  
- Speed measurement via Doppler radar  
- Environmental sensing (lighting conditions)  
- Raw data capture and initial processing  

#### **Layer 2: Edge Processing Layer (Raspberry Pi 5)**  
**Core Services:**  
- Vehicle Detection Service (TensorFlow + OpenCV + AI Camera)  
- Speed Analysis Service (OPS243-C radar data processing)  
- Multi-Vehicle Tracking Service (SORT algorithm implementation)  
- Data Fusion Engine (Camera + Radar correlation)  
- Weather Integration Service (API calls to weather providers)  
- Anomaly Detection Service (Traffic pattern analysis)  

**Supporting Components:**  
- **Edge UI (Local Web Dashboard)**: Provides **real-time visualization** of detections and speeds.  
- System Health Monitor (Watchdog timers, performance metrics)  
- Local Storage Manager (tmpfs, SSD data management)  
- Edge API Gateway (Flask-SocketIO server)  

**Responsibilities:**  
- Real-time ML inference and vehicle detection  
- Multi-sensor data fusion and correlation  
- Traffic pattern analysis and anomaly detection  
- Local data storage and management  
- System reliability and health monitoring  

#### **Layer 3: Network & Communication Layer**  
**Components:**  
- Local Network Interface (WiFi/Ethernet connectivity)  
- WebSocket Server (Real-time data streaming)  
- REST API Endpoints (Configuration and status)  
- Data Compression & Queuing (Optimized cloud transmission)  
- Network Resilience (Offline-first operation, reconnection logic)  

**UI Integration:**  
- Enables **communication between Edge UI and Cloud UI**  
- Handles **data streaming for real-time monitoring**  
- Supports **API requests for external system integration**  

**Optional Backup:**  
- Cellular Modem (5G/LTE for remote locations)  
- Mesh Networking (Multi-unit coordination)  

#### **Layer 4: Cloud Services Layer (Optional)**  
**Data Services:**  
- Data Aggregation Service (AWS Lambda + DynamoDB or similar)  
- Time Series Database (Traffic metrics storage)  
- Data Analytics Engine (Historical pattern analysis)  
- Model Update Service (ML model versioning and deployment)  

**Application Services:**  
- **Cloud UI (Web-Based Dashboard)**: Centralized interface for viewing **historical traffic trends, reports, and alerts**.  
- Alert & Notification Service (Email/SMS alerts for incidents)  
- API Gateway (External system integration)  
- User Management (Authentication and access control)  

**Supporting Infrastructure:**  
- Message Queue (MQTT broker or AWS SQS)  
- File Storage (S3 or similar for images/videos)  
- Content Delivery (CloudFront for dashboard assets)  

**Responsibilities:**  
- Long-term data storage and historical analysis  
- Advanced analytics and reporting  
- Remote system management and updates  
- Integration with city traffic management systems  

### **UI Layer Breakdown**  

#### **Edge UI (Local Web Dashboard - Layer 2)**  
- **Real-time visualization** of vehicle detections and speed data.  
- **Direct interaction** with edge processing services (Flask-SocketIO).  
- **Configuration controls** for system adjustments.  

#### **Cloud UI (Web-Based Dashboard - Layer 4)**  
- **Advanced analytics** with historical traffic patterns.  
- **Incident alerts and reports** for traffic violations.  
- **Remote management** of edge devices and ML models.  

### **Data Flow Architecture**  

#### **Real-Time Processing Flow:**  
**Physical Sensors → Edge Processing → Local Dashboard (Edge UI)**  
↓  
**Raw Data → Processed Intelligence → Real-Time Visualization**  

#### **Cloud Integration Flow (When Available):**  
**Edge Processing → Network Layer → Cloud Services → Web-Based Dashboard (Cloud UI)**  
↓  
**Local Storage → Data Queue → Cloud Storage → Analytics/Alerts**  

This updated version explicitly defines the **UI Layer**, clarifying its role within **Layer 2 (Edge UI)** and **Layer 4 (Cloud UI)**.  

Does this match what you had in mind? I can refine it further based on how you plan to implement the UI or specific front-end frameworks you're considering!
