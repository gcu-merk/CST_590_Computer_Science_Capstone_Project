Thank you for providing the OPS243-C datasheet! This gives me much more detailed information about your sensor. Based on the datasheet, I can now provide more accurate connection details and power analysis:
Updated Power Analysis:
Looking at the datasheet specifications, the OPS243-C power consumption is:

Active: 330-375 mA at 5V (1.65-1.875W)
Idle: 140-158 mA at 5V (0.7-0.79W)
Hibernate: 34 mA at 5V (0.17W)

Updated Total Power Draw:

Pi 5: ~1-2A
Samsung T7 SSD: ~0.5A
AI Camera: ~0.2-0.3A
OPS243-C Active: ~0.375A
Total: ~2.1-3.2A - well within your 5A supply capacity

Confirmed Connection Details:
Based on the datasheet Table 3 (Revision D boards), your connections are:
Power:

OPS243-C Pin 9 (5-24V Power) → Pi Pin 2 or 4 (5V)
OPS243-C Pin 10 (Ground) → Pi Pin 6 (Ground)

UART Data (recommended):

OPS243-C Pin 6 (UART_RxD) → Pi Pin 8 (GPIO14/UART0_TXD)
OPS243-C Pin 7 (UART_TxD) → Pi Pin 10 (GPIO15/UART0_RXD)

Optional Control:

OPS243-C Pin 4 (/Reset) → Pi Pin 11 (GPIO17)
OPS243-C Pin 3 (Host Interrupt) → Pi Pin 13 (GPIO27)

Key Features from Datasheet:

Default UART: 19,200 baud, 8N1
Reports speed, direction, and range at ~13-14 Hz
Detection range: 10-20m for humans, 50-100m for vehicles
20° horizontal × 24° vertical beam width
Simple ASCII or JSON API

Your 5V/5A power supply provides excellent headroom for this complete setup!


On the Raspberry Pi 5, the UART pins are located on the 40-pin GPIO header:
RPi5 UART pins:

Pin 8 (GPIO 14) - TX (transmit)
Pin 10 (GPIO 16) - RX (receive)

Complete connection mapping:

OPS243 UART_TxD (J3 pin 7) → RPi5 pin 10 (GPIO 16 RX)
OPS243 UART_RxD (J3 pin 6) → RPi5 pin 8 (GPIO 14 TX)
OPS243 Power (J3 pin 9) → RPi5 pin 2 (5V) or external 5V supply
OPS243 Ground (J3 pin 10) → RPi5 pin 6 (Ground)

Using your wire colors:

White wire: OPS243 J3 pin 7 → RPi5 pin 10
Green wire: OPS243 J3 pin 6 → RPi5 pin 8
Red wire: OPS243 J3 pin 9 → RPi5 pin 2 (5V)
Black wire: OPS243 J3 pin 10 → RPi5 pin 6 (Ground)

Note: The RPi5 uses the same GPIO pin numbering as previous Raspberry Pi models for UART0 (the primary UART interface).
