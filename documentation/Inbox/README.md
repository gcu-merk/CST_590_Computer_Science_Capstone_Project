## Purpose

This organization serves multiple purposes:

1. **Clean Repository Structure** - Keeps the root directory focused on core application files
2. **Deployment Optimization** - Documentation files are excluded from production deployments
3. **Better Organization** - All documentation is centralized in the documentation folder
4. **Maintenance** - Easier to manage and update documentation in a dedicated location

## Next Steps

These files can be:
- Reviewed and organized into appropriate documentation categories
- Merged with existing documentation where applicable
- Archived if no longer needed
- Moved to more specific documentation subdirectories
