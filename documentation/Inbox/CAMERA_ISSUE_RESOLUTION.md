# Camera Issue Resolution Summary

## Problem Identified ✅

**Root Cause:** The main application (`main_edge_app.py`) successfully claims the camera using picamera2, but the Docker image was missing `fswebcam` for system-level fallback capture.

## Diagnostic Results

### Hardware & Permissions ✅

- ✅ Camera devices exist: `/dev/video0-7` with correct permissions
- ✅ IMX500 camera properly detected via `rp1-cfe` driver
- ✅ Container has root access and proper device mounting

### Software Stack Issues ❌

- ❌ `fswebcam` not installed in Docker image
- ❌ Multiple processes trying to access camera simultaneously
- ❌ Main app (`PID 1`) has camera claimed via picamera2
- ❌ Secondary access attempts fail with "Device or resource busy"

### Camera Access Pattern

1. **Main app**: Uses picamera2 successfully (primary interface)
2. **OpenCV**: Fails with "can't open camera by index" (device busy)
3. **fswebcam**: Failed with "Device or resource busy" (was missing from image)
4. **Fallback logic**: Should work but fswebcam wasn't available

## Solution Implemented ✅

### 1. Updated Dockerfile

```dockerfile
# Added fswebcam to camera tools section
    v4l-utils \
    fswebcam \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

### 2. Expected Behavior After Fix

- ✅ Main app continues using picamera2 (primary method)
- ✅ fswebcam available for system-level capture fallback
- ✅ Application can capture frames even when primary methods fail
- ✅ Reduced "Failed to capture frame" warnings

## Testing Plan

### 1. Wait for New Image Deployment (~15-20 minutes)

```bash
# Check build status
docker system df

# Monitor deployment (use compose logs or container-id)
docker compose logs traffic-monitor --tail=20 -f
```

### 2. Verify Fix

```bash
# Test fswebcam availability (exec into resolved container)
docker exec $(docker ps -q --filter "label=com.docker.compose.service=traffic-monitor" | head -1) fswebcam --version

# Test camera capture with running app
docker compose exec traffic-monitor bash -c "
  # Stop main app temporarily
  kill 1
  sleep 2
  # Test fswebcam
  fswebcam --device /dev/video0 --no-banner /tmp/test.jpg
  ls -la /tmp/test.jpg
  # Restart container
"
```

### 3. Application Testing

```bash
# Check for reduced warnings in logs
docker compose logs traffic-monitor --tail=50 | grep -i "failed to capture"

# Test health endpoint
curl -s http://localhost:5000/api/health | jq '.camera_status'

# Check for successful snapshots
docker exec $(docker ps -q --filter "label=com.docker.compose.service=traffic-monitor" | head -1) ls -la /mnt/storage/periodic_snapshots/
```

## Success Criteria

- [ ] No more "fswebcam: command not found" errors
- [ ] Reduced frequency of "Failed to capture frame" warnings
- [ ] Periodic snapshots being created successfully
- [ ] Health endpoint shows camera as functional
- [ ] System gracefully handles camera resource conflicts

## Next Steps if Issues Persist

1. **Camera Sharing Logic**: Implement proper camera resource management
2. **Alternative Devices**: Test with other video devices (`/dev/video1-7`)
3. **Process Coordination**: Add camera release/acquire logic between main app and fallback
4. **Monitoring**: Enhanced logging to track camera access patterns

## Files Modified

- ✅ `Dockerfile` - Added fswebcam package
- ✅ Git committed and pushed (triggers new image build)

## Timeline

- **Fix Applied**: Now
- **Build Time**: ~15-20 minutes  
- **Deployment**: Automatic via CI/CD
- **Verification**: Ready for testing after deployment completes
