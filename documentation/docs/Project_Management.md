## 3. Risk Management Matrix

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|------------|---------------------|
| Hardware failure (Pi, camera, radar) | High | Medium | Use quality components, keep spares, monitor health indicators |
| Data loss (storage failure) | High | Low | Regular backups, use SSD for reliability, monitor storage usage |
| ML model inaccuracy | Medium | Medium | Use diverse training data, validate with real-world samples, retrain as needed |
| Network outage | Medium | Medium | Offline-first design, local storage, auto-reconnect logic |
| Power loss | High | Low | Use UPS or PoE with backup, monitor power status |
| Security breach (API, dashboard) | High | Low | Use authentication, HTTPS, regular updates, firewall |
| Integration bugs (sensor fusion, API) | Medium | Medium | Incremental testing, code reviews, automated tests |
| Regulatory/compliance issues | Medium | Low | Review local laws, anonymize data, document compliance |
