   - A colored box (bounding box) appears around the vehicle in the video feed
   - The box color or label shows the vehicle type:
     - üöó **Blue box** = Car / Passenger vehicle
     - üöö **Green box** = Truck / Large vehicle
     - üèçÔ∏è **Yellow box** = Motorcycle
     - üöå **Red box** = Bus

2. **Speed Display:**
   - A number appears next to the vehicle showing its speed
   - Example: "**35 mph**" or "**56 km/h**"

3. **Event Entry:**
   - A new row appears in the event table below the video
   - Shows timestamp, vehicle type, speed, and direction

#### Understanding the Event Table

Each detection creates a new row in the table with the following information:

| Column | What It Means | Example |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| **Timestamp** | Date and time the vehicle was detected | 2025-12-20 14:32:15 |
| **Vehicle Type** | What kind of vehicle it is | Car, Truck, Motorcycle, Bus |
| **Speed** | How fast the vehicle was traveling | 35 mph, 56 km/h |
| **Direction** | Which way the vehicle was going | Inbound, Outbound, North, South |
| **Confidence** | How sure the AI is about the vehicle type | 95% (higher is better) |
| **Source** | Which sensor detected it | Camera, Radar, or Fusion (both) |

**What Do the Confidence Scores Mean?**

- **90-100%** = Very confident ‚úÖ (Highly reliable)
- **75-89%** = Confident ‚ö†Ô∏è (Generally reliable)
- **60-74%** = Somewhat confident ‚ÑπÔ∏è (Less reliable, verify if important)
- **Below 60%** = Low confidence ‚ùå (May be inaccurate)

#### Filtering and Searching Events

**How to Read It:**
- **Two lines** (one for each direction)
- **Blue line:** Traffic flowing one direction (e.g., Northbound)
- **Orange line:** Traffic flowing opposite direction (e.g., Southbound)

**What to Look For:**
- **Balanced lines:** Equal traffic both directions
- **Imbalanced lines:** One direction much busier (common during rush hour)
- **Crossover points:** Times when traffic direction switches

**Example Interpretation:**
```
7:00 AM: Inbound = 80 vehicles, Outbound = 25 vehicles
5:00 PM: Inbound = 30 vehicles, Outbound = 95 vehicles

Interpretation: Morning commute into town, evening commute out of town

## 6. FAQ

### 6.1 General Questions

**Q: What types of vehicles can the system detect?**

A: The AI camera can detect and classify cars, trucks, motorcycles, and buses. Detection accuracy is highest for standard passenger vehicles (85-95%) and decreases slightly for unusual vehicle types or motorcycles due to their smaller size.

**Q: How accurate is the speed measurement?**

A: The OPS243-C radar sensor provides ¬±2 mph accuracy for vehicles traveling up to 60 mph under normal conditions. Accuracy may decrease in adverse weather or with very small vehicles (motorcycles, bicycles).

**Q: Can the system work in all weather conditions?**

A: Yes, the system is designed for outdoor use with an IP65-rated enclosure. The radar sensor works reliably in all weather conditions including rain, snow, and fog. Camera-based AI classification may have reduced accuracy in very poor visibility but the radar will continue to detect vehicles and measure speed.

**Q: How much data storage is required?**

A: With default settings, the system generates approximately 1-2 GB of data per day, including logs, detection events, and periodic image captures. The recommended 1TB external SSD provides several months to over a year of storage, depending on traffic volume and retention settings.

**Q: Is the system compliant with privacy regulations?**

A: Yes. All AI processing occurs on the IMX500 camera sensor itself, and the system does not store continuous video footage by default. Only metadata (timestamps, vehicle types, speeds) is logged. The system can be configured to capture snapshots for verification purposes, with appropriate retention policies to comply with local privacy laws.

**Q: Can I integrate this system with existing traffic management systems?**

A: Yes. The system provides REST and WebSocket APIs that can be integrated with external traffic management platforms. See the Technical Design Document for API specifications and integration examples.

### 6.2 Technical Questions

**Q: What network connectivity is required?**

A: The system requires an internet connection for cloud synchronization and remote access. Local operation (Edge UI) works without internet. Minimum bandwidth requirement is 1 Mbps for cloud features. For optimal performance, 5-10 Mbps is recommended, especially if capturing and uploading snapshots.

**Q: Can I access the system remotely?**

A: Yes. The system supports secure remote access using Tailscale, a mesh VPN that creates a private network between your devices. Tailscale allows you to SSH or access the dashboard from anywhere, as if you were on the same local network. See the Implementation & Deployment Guide for setup instructions.

**Q: How do I connect to the Raspberry Pi using Tailscale?**

A: After installing and authenticating Tailscale on both your Raspberry Pi and your client device (laptop/desktop), you can use the Tailscale-assigned IP address to SSH into the Pi or access the web dashboard. Example:

```bash
ssh merk@100.121.231.16
```

Or open `http://100.121.231.16:5000` in your browser. Ensure Tailscale is running and connected on both devices. For more details, see the Implementation & Deployment Guide.

**Q: How do I calibrate the speed measurement?**

A: The OPS243-C radar sensor is factory-calibrated and typically requires no additional calibration. However, you can verify accuracy by comparing readings with a GPS speedometer or radar gun. If you notice consistent offsets, check the radar orientation and mounting. Contact support if recalibration is needed.

**Q: What happens if the power goes out?**

A: The system will automatically resume normal operation when power is restored. All services are configured to start on boot. If you have a UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply), the Raspberry Pi can continue operating for several hours during outages, depending on UPS capacity.

**Q: How do I back up my data?**

A: You can back up data using several methods:

1. **Manual backup:**
   ```bash
   # Copy database to backup location
   cp /mnt/storage/traffic.db /path/to/backup/
   ```

2. **Automated backup script:**
   ```bash
   # Run backup script (if configured)
   ./scripts/backup_data.sh
   ```

3. **Cloud synchronization:** Enable cloud sync in settings to automatically upload data to cloud storage.

**Q: Can I adjust detection sensitivity or thresholds?**

A: Yes, detection thresholds and sensitivity can be adjusted in the configuration files. This allows you to fine-tune the system for your specific deployment:

- **AI Confidence Threshold:** Minimum confidence score for vehicle classification (default: 0.70)
- **Speed Threshold:** Minimum/maximum speed for logging (e.g., ignore stationary objects)
- **ROI (Region of Interest):** Define specific areas of the camera frame to monitor

See the Technical Design Document for detailed configuration parameters.

**Q: How many vehicles can the system handle simultaneously?**

A: The system can reliably process 3-5 vehicles simultaneously in the camera's field of view. The IMX500's on-chip AI can handle multiple detections in a single frame, and the radar can track multiple targets. Performance depends on vehicle spacing and speed.

### 6.3 Troubleshooting Questions

**Q: The dashboard shows "No data" - what should I check?**

A:

1. Verify the camera and radar connections
2. Check that all services are running: `docker compose ps`
3. Ensure the database is accessible: `ls -la /mnt/storage/traffic.db`
4. Look for error messages in the system logs: `docker compose logs --tail=50`

See the [Troubleshooting](#5-troubleshooting) section for detailed solutions.

**Q: How do I update the system software?**

A: Software updates should be performed carefully to avoid disrupting service:

1. **Backup your data first:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/backup_data.sh
   ```

2. **Pull latest code:**
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

3. **Rebuild containers:**

   ```

4. **Verify services:**
   ```bash
   docker compose ps
   ```

Always backup your data before performing updates. See the Implementation & Deployment Guide for detailed update procedures.

**Q: Why are my vehicle classifications inaccurate?**

A: Inaccurate classifications can result from several factors:

1. **Poor lighting:** Ensure adequate lighting for camera
2. **Camera angle:** Optimize camera position for side or front/rear vehicle views
3. **Dirty lens:** Clean camera lens with microfiber cloth
4. **Wrong ROI:** Adjust region of interest to focus on road area
5. **Low confidence threshold:** Increase threshold to filter low-confidence detections

See [Vehicle Detections Seem Inaccurate](#vehicle-detections-seem-inaccurate) for detailed troubleshooting steps.

**Q: How do I reset the system to factory defaults?**

A: To reset the system:

1. **Backup important data first**
2. **Stop all services:**
   ```bash
   docker compose down
   ```

3. **Remove data volumes:**
   ```bash
   docker volume rm $(docker volume ls -q)
   ```

4. **Restore default configuration:**
   ```bash
   cp config/default_config.yaml config/config.yaml
   ```

5. **Restart services:**
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** This will delete all historical data and reset all settings.
