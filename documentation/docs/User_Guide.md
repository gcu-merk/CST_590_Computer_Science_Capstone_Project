#### Checking Radar Service Status

To verify the radar service is running properly:

```bash
# Connect to your Pi via SSH
ssh user@your-pi-ip

# Check if radar service container is running
docker ps | grep radar-service

# Expected output: radar-service container with "healthy" status
```

#### Monitoring Live Radar Detections

View real-time vehicle detections as they happen:

```bash
# Follow radar service logs in real-time
docker logs radar-service -f

# Example output when a vehicle passes:
# ð Vehicle detected: 23.9 mph (magnitude: unknown)
# â ï¸  LOW SPEED ALERT: 23.9 mph
```

#### Checking Recent Detections in Redis

View the last few vehicle detections stored in Redis:

```bash
# Check last 5 radar detections
docker exec redis redis-cli XREVRANGE radar_data + - COUNT 5

# Check latest consolidated record
docker exec redis redis-cli GET consolidation:latest
```

### 6.2 System Health Dashboard

#### Accessing the Web Dashboard

1. **Find your Pi's IP address:**
   - Local network: `http://192.168.1.75:5000` (replace with your Pi's IP)
   - Tailscale VPN: `http://100.x.x.x:5000` (use `tailscale ip` to find IP)

2. **Dashboard sections to check:**
   - **System Status**: Shows if all services are running
   - **Recent Detections**: Displays latest vehicle detections with timestamps
   - **Radar Health**: Indicates radar sensor connectivity and data quality

#### Health Check Endpoint
