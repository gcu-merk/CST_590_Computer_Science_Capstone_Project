## Phased Implementation Overview
> **Note:**
> This plan is guided by a Minimal Viable Product (MVP)-first approach, emphasizing incremental development, future extensibility, and robust risk management. The project is structured so that Phase 1 delivers a working MVP, with subsequent phases designed for future implementation as time and resources allow. For full feedback and rationale, see [AI Feedback for Capstone Completion plan](../archive/AI%20Feedback%20for%20Capstone%20Completion%20plan.txt).

- Simple speed calculation using radar FFT

### Phase 2: Advanced Processing

- Custom motion analysis and vehicle velocity calculation
- Lane detection and basic sensor fusion
- Traffic analytics and pattern recognition

### Phase 3: Intelligent Systems

- Advanced sensor fusion (ML-based)
- Anomaly detection and predictive analytics
