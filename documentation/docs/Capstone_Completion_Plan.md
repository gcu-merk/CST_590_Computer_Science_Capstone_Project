# Capstone Completion Plan

## Executive Summary

This project aims to deliver a robust, edge-based traffic monitoring system using a Raspberry Pi 5, AI camera, and radar sensor. The plan is structured in four phases, each mapped to clear milestones. As of now, Milestone 1 is 65% complete and on track for Week 2 delivery. Key risks include hardware integration and algorithm performance, both being actively mitigated. The following dashboard and sections provide a snapshot of progress, dependencies, and next steps.

## Phased Implementation Overview

> **Note:**
> This plan is guided by a Minimal Viable Product (MVP)-first approach, emphasizing incremental development, future extensibility, and robust risk management. The project is structured so that Phase 1 delivers a working MVP, with subsequent phases designed for future implementation as time and resources allow. For full feedback and rationale, see [AI Feedback for Capstone Completion plan](../archive/AI%20Feedback%20for%20Capstone%20Completion%20plan.txt) and [Peer Feedback for Capstone Completion plan](../archive/Capstone_Completion_Plan_Peer_Feedback.txt).

The project is delivered in four major phases, each building on the previous:

### Phase 1: Core Detection

- Integrate Sony IMX500 camera and basic hardware
- Deploy YOLOv8 object detection (pre-trained)
- Implement basic object tracking (SORT/DeepSORT)
- Simple speed calculation using radar FFT

### Phase 2: Advanced Processing

- Custom motion analysis and vehicle velocity calculation
- Lane detection and basic sensor fusion
- Traffic analytics and pattern recognition

### Phase 3: Intelligent Systems

- Advanced sensor fusion (ML-based)
- Anomaly detection and predictive analytics
- Adaptive learning and system self-improvement

### Phase 4: Optimization

- Performance optimization for real-time processing
- Environmental adaptation (weather, lighting)
- Advanced calibration and meta-learning

Each milestone/component in the plan below is mapped to its corresponding phase for clarity and traceability.
