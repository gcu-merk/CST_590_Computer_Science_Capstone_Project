# Capstone Completion Plan 2

## Executive Summary

This project aims to deliver a robust, edge-based traffic monitoring system using a Raspberry Pi 5, AI camera, and radar sensor. The plan is structured in four phases, each mapped to clear milestones. As of now, Milestone 1 is 65% complete and on track for Week 2 delivery. Key risks include hardware integration and algorithm performance, both being actively mitigated. The following dashboard and sections provide a snapshot of progress, dependencies, and next steps.

## Phased Implementation Overview

> **Moving from planning to execution:** The following milestones translate our phased approach into specific deliverables and timelines.

The project is delivered in four major phases, each building on the previous:

### Phase 1: Core Detection
- Integrate Sony IMX500 camera and basic hardware
- Deploy YOLOv8 object detection (pre-trained)
- Implement basic object tracking (SORT/DeepSORT)
- Simple speed calculation using radar FFT

### Phase 2: Advanced Processing
- Custom motion analysis and vehicle velocity calculation
- Lane detection and basic sensor fusion
- Traffic analytics and pattern recognition

### Phase 3: Intelligent Systems
- Advanced sensor fusion (ML-based)
- Anomaly detection and predictive analytics
- Adaptive learning and system self-improvement

### Phase 4: Optimization
- Performance optimization for real-time processing
- Environmental adaptation (weather, lighting)
- Advanced calibration and meta-learning

## Key Dependencies

- Hardware setup (M1) must be completed before software integration (M2)
- YOLOv8 model selection (M2) must be finalized before implementation (M3)
- Basic object detection (M3) is required for speed calculation features (M3)
- All core features (M3) must be implemented before optimization (M4)
