# Capstone Completion Plan 2

## Executive Summary

This project aims to deliver a robust, edge-based traffic monitoring system using a Raspberry Pi 5, AI camera, and radar sensor. The plan is structured in four phases, each mapped to clear milestones. As of now, Milestone 1 is 65% complete and on track for Week 2 delivery. Key risks include hardware integration and algorithm performance, both being actively mitigated. The following dashboard and sections provide a snapshot of progress, dependencies, and next steps.

- Create initial system health monitoring

### Phase 2 (Weeks 3-4): Add Radar Integration and Simple Correlation

- Integrate OPS243-C FMCW Doppler radar sensor
- Implement GPIO/UART communication for radar data
- Develop basic data fusion between camera and radar
- Create simple speed correlation algorithms
- Establish real-time data processing pipeline

### Phase 3 (Weeks 5-6): Build Web Interface and API

- Develop Flask-SocketIO API gateway
- Create real-time WebSocket communication
- Build web-based dashboard for monitoring
- Implement REST endpoints for data access
- Add system configuration management

### Phase 4 (Weeks 7-8): Integration Testing, Documentation and Basic Optimization
