## 1. System Overview
The Raspberry Pi 5 Edge ML Traffic Monitoring System is designed to provide real-time vehicle detection, speed measurement, and traffic analytics at the edge. The system leverages a Raspberry Pi 5, an AI-enabled camera, and an OmniPreSense OPS243-C radar sensor to process video and radar data locally, sending only processed results to cloud services for aggregation and reporting. This approach reduces bandwidth, increases privacy, and enables rapid response to traffic events.

**Objectives:**
- Deploy a low-cost, scalable, and reliable edge-based traffic monitoring solution
- Integrate ML/AI for vehicle detection, classification, and anomaly detection
- Fuse camera and radar data for accurate speed and event measurement
- Provide real-time dashboards and cloud-based analytics

**Key Features:**
- Local ML inference and data fusion
- Real-time web dashboard (Edge UI)
- Cloud integration for historical analytics and alerts (Cloud UI)
- Modular, container-friendly architecture

## 5. Key API Specifications

The system exposes REST and WebSocket APIs for local dashboard access, system configuration, and cloud integration. Below are the main endpoints and their purposes.

### Backend (Flask/Flask-SocketIO)

**REST Endpoints:**

- `GET /api/vehicle_events` â€” Retrieve recent vehicle events
- `GET /api/radar_readings` â€” Retrieve recent radar readings
- `GET /api/camera_detections` â€” Retrieve recent camera detections
- `POST /api/config` â€” Update system configuration (e.g., thresholds, network)
- `GET /api/health` â€” System health/status check

**WebSocket Events:**
- `vehicle_event` â€” Real-time push of new vehicle events
- `system_status` â€” Real-time system health updates

**Example REST Request:**
```
GET /api/vehicle_events?limit=10
Response:
[
  {
    "id": 123,
    "timestamp": "2025-08-07T14:32:00Z",
    "location": "Maple St & 5th Ave",
    "source": "fusion",
    "radar_reading_id": 456,
    "camera_detection_id": 789
  },
  ...
]
```

**Example WebSocket Event:**
```
{
  "event": "vehicle_event",
  "data": {
    "timestamp": "2025-08-07T14:32:00Z",
    "vehicle_type": "car",
    "speed": 12.3,
    "location": "Maple St & 5th Ave"
  }
}
```

### Dashboard (Edge UI & Cloud UI)

- Consumes the above APIs for real-time and historical data display
- Provides user authentication (Cloud UI)
- Allows configuration and monitoring of edge devices

**Note:** Mobile app (if implemented) would use the same API endpoints as the dashboard.

## 6. Data Processing Pipeline

### Data Flow: Sensor to Dashboard
1. **Sensing:**
   - The AI Camera captures video frames; the OPS243-C radar sensor measures vehicle speed and range.
2. **Edge Processing:**
   - Video frames are processed by a TensorFlow/OpenCV pipeline for vehicle detection and classification.
   - Radar data is parsed and filtered for valid speed events.
3. **Data Fusion:**
   - Detected vehicles from the camera are correlated with radar speed readings using timestamp and spatial proximity.
   - Fused events are created, combining vehicle type, speed, and location.
4. **Event Logging:**
   - Fused events, raw radar readings, and camera detections are stored in the local database.
5. **Visualization & API:**
   - Real-time events are streamed to the Edge UI dashboard via WebSocket.
   - Historical and summary data is available via REST API.
6. **Cloud Sync (Optional):**
   - Processed events are periodically uploaded to the cloud for aggregation, analytics, and alerting.

### ML/AI Integration
- **Vehicle Detection:** TensorFlow (object detection model) and OpenCV are used to identify and classify vehicles in real time.
- **Tracking:** SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) algorithm is used for multi-vehicle tracking across frames.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Optional ML models can flag unusual traffic patterns or events.

### Data Fusion & Analytics
- **Fusion Logic:** Combines camera and radar data to improve accuracy of speed and vehicle type assignment.
- **Analytics:**
  - Real-time: Vehicle counts, speed distributions, violation detection (e.g., speeding)
  - Historical: Aggregated traffic trends, anomaly reports, and system health metrics

## 7. Security Considerations

### Edge Device Security
- **Physical Security:** Secure enclosure with tamper detection, locked access panels
- **Boot Security:** Secure boot process, encrypted file system (LUKS)
- **Network Security:** VPN tunneling for cloud communication, firewall configuration
- **Access Control:** SSH key-based authentication, disabled default passwords

### API Security
- **Authentication:** JWT tokens or API keys for all endpoints
- **Authorization:** Role-based access control (RBAC) for different user types
- **Encryption:** HTTPS/TLS 1.3 for all API communication
- **Rate Limiting:** Prevent DoS attacks with request throttling

### Data Privacy & Compliance
- **Data Minimization:** Store only necessary metadata, avoid personal identification
- **Anonymization:** Blur license plates, faces in stored video data
- **Retention Policy:** Automatic deletion of old data per privacy requirements
- **Compliance:** GDPR, CCPA, and local privacy law adherence

### System Monitoring
- **Intrusion Detection:** Monitor for unauthorized access attempts
- **Audit Logging:** Comprehensive logs of all system activities
- **Security Updates:** Automated security patching and vulnerability management
- **Backup Security:** Encrypted backups with secure key management

## 9. Future Work & Clarifications

### Future Work
- **Stop Sign Violation Detection:** Planned for future implementation. The current system focuses on speed and general vehicle detection. Stop sign violation detection is a key roadmap feature (see [GitHub repo](https://github.com/gcu-merk/CST_590_Computer_Science_Capstone_Project)).
- **Alert/Notification System:** Customizable alerting is planned. Current documentation describes the architecture; implementation is in progress.
- **Cloud/Remote Monitoring:** Cloud UI and analytics are described in the documentation. Full cloud integration and remote monitoring are planned enhancements.
- **User Interface Enhancements:** Ongoing improvements to dashboard usability and configuration options.
- **Detection Accuracy:** Improve performance in challenging lighting and weather conditions.
- **Advanced Deep Learning:** Explore new ML models for better detection/classification.

### Contradictions & Clarifications
- The GitHub repository emphasizes stop sign violation detection and customizable alerts as core features. The current deployed system focuses on speed and vehicle detection; stop sign and advanced alerting are future work.
- Both sources mention cloud/remote monitoring. The documentation describes the intended architecture; some features may be in development.
- The dashboard is described as implemented in the documentation, but the GitHub repo lists it as future work. Clarify the current status in project updates.
