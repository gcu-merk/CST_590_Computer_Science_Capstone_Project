# CI/CD Deployment Script for Traffic Monitoring System
# Separates host services (camera capture) from containerized services (processing/API)

#
# Architecture:
# - Host Service: camera capture (requires direct hardware access)
# - Containerized: AI processing, API, data maintenance, web services
