# Enhanced IMX500 Camera Service - Deployment Guide

## üéØ Overview
The IMX500 camera service has been successfully enhanced with centralized logging and correlation tracking. This service runs as a systemd host service (not containerized) for optimal AI processing performance.

## üìã What's Complete

### ‚úÖ Enhanced Camera Service
- **File**: `scripts/imx500_ai_host_capture_enhanced.py` (764 lines)
- **Features**: 
  - Centralized logging with ServiceLogger integration
  - Correlation tracking with radar events via Redis
  - Business event logging for AI processing metrics
  - Performance monitoring with timing decorators
  - Sony IMX500 on-chip AI processing for sub-100ms vehicle detection
  - Real-time correlation with radar speed detection

### ‚úÖ Updated System Integration
- **Systemd Service**: Both `imx500-ai-capture.service` files updated to use enhanced version
- **Deployment Script**: `deployment/deploy-imx500-ai-service.sh` updated for enhanced service
- **Environment Variables**: Added centralized logging configuration
- **Validation Script**: `test_enhanced_camera_service.py` for testing logging integration

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### 1. Deploy Enhanced Service
```bash
# On Raspberry Pi
sudo ./deployment/deploy-imx500-ai-service.sh
```

### 2. Verify Service Status
```bash
# Check service status
sudo systemctl status imx500-ai-capture

# View logs
journalctl -f -u imx500-ai-capture

# Check for centralized logging
tail -f /mnt/storage/logs/imx500_camera.log
```

### 3. Test Correlation Pipeline
```bash
# Ensure Redis is running
sudo systemctl start redis

# Start radar service (if not already running)
sudo systemctl start radar-service

# Start enhanced camera service
sudo systemctl start imx500-ai-capture

# Monitor correlation in logs
journalctl -f -u imx500-ai-capture | grep "radar_camera_correlation"
```

## üîó Correlation Pipeline Flow

1. **Radar Detection**: OPS243-C radar detects vehicle ‚Üí generates correlation ID
2. **Event Publishing**: Radar publishes event to Redis with correlation ID
3. **Camera Trigger**: IMX500 captures and processes with on-chip AI
4. **Correlation Lookup**: Camera service retrieves radar event using correlation ID  
5. **Combined Analysis**: Correlates AI detection with radar speed data
6. **Unified Logging**: Both events logged with same correlation ID for tracing

## üìä Key Logging Events

### Business Events Logged:
- `service_initialization`: Service startup with configuration
- `camera_initialization_start/success/failure`: Camera setup status
- `ai_model_loaded`: IMX500 model loading confirmation
- `capture_start`: New capture initiated with correlation ID
- `vehicle_detection_success`: AI detected vehicles in street ROI
- `no_vehicles_detected`: No vehicles found in current capture
- `radar_camera_correlation`: Successful correlation with radar event
- `performance_monitoring`: AI processing timing metrics

### Performance Metrics:
- AI inference time (sub-100ms on IMX500)
- Total processing time per capture
- Capture success/failure rates
- Vehicle detection counts
- Correlation success rates

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables (Set in systemd service):
```bash
# Core Configuration
CAMERA_CAPTURE_DIR=/mnt/storage/camera_capture
IMX500_MODEL_PATH=/usr/share/imx500-models/imx500_network_ssd_mobilenetv2_fpnlite_320x320_pp.rpk
CAPTURE_INTERVAL=1.0
AI_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD=0.5

# Redis Configuration
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379

# Centralized Logging
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
LOG_DIR=/mnt/storage/logs
SERVICE_NAME=imx500_camera

# Street ROI (Region of Interest)
STREET_ROI_X_START=0.15
STREET_ROI_X_END=0.85
STREET_ROI_Y_START=0.5
STREET_ROI_Y_END=0.9
```

## üéØ Validation Checklist

- [ ] Enhanced camera service deployed and running
- [ ] Centralized logging active in `/mnt/storage/logs/imx500_camera.log`
- [ ] Redis correlation working with radar events
- [ ] Business events logged with correlation IDs
- [ ] Performance metrics captured for AI processing
- [ ] No errors in systemd service logs
- [ ] IMX500 AI model loaded successfully
- [ ] Vehicle detections correlating with radar events

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **IMX500 Model Not Found**: Ensure model path exists: `/usr/share/imx500-models/imx500_network_ssd_mobilenetv2_fpnlite_320x320_pp.rpk`
2. **Redis Connection Failed**: Check Redis service: `sudo systemctl status redis`
3. **Camera Initialization Failed**: Verify picamera2 installation and IMX500 hardware
4. **Missing Correlation**: Ensure radar service is running and publishing events
5. **Logging Directory**: Verify `/mnt/storage/logs` exists and is writable

### Log Analysis:
```bash
# Filter for correlation events
journalctl -u imx500-ai-capture | grep "correlation_id"

# Monitor performance metrics  
journalctl -u imx500-ai-capture | grep "performance_monitoring"

# Check AI processing times
journalctl -u imx500-ai-capture | grep "inference_time_ms"
```

## üìà Next Steps
