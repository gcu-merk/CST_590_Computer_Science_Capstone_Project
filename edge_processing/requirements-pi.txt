# Raspberry Pi specific packages  
# Note: picamera2 excluded - system uses host-capture/container-process architecture
# Camera capture handled by host Pi, containers process shared volume images
gpiozero>=1.6.2          # Simplified GPIO control
# RPi.GPIO removed - using lgpio for Pi 5 compatibility
gpustat>=1.1.1          # GPU monitoring for Pi 5
redis>=4.6.0            # Redis client for real-time messaging
lgpio>=0.2.2.0          # Low-level GPIO library (lgpio daemon)
pyserial>=3.5           # Serial communication for OPS243 radar

# Computer vision and image processing for weather analysis
opencv-python>=4.5.0    # OpenCV for image processing and sky analysis
numpy>=1.21.0           # Numerical computing for image analysis
scikit-image>=0.19.0    # Advanced image processing algorithms

# Modern GPIO libraries for Raspberry Pi 5
lgpio>=0.2.2.0          # Low-level GPIO library (primary GPIO access for Pi 5)
gpiozero>=1.6.2          # Simplified GPIO control
# RPi.GPIO removed - lgpio provides better Pi 5 compatibility
