#### Local Network Access (Alternative)

If accessing from the same local network as the Raspberry Pi:

1. **Find your Raspberry Pi's IP address:**
   ```bash
   hostname -I
   ```

2. **Access the traffic-monitor API directly:**
   ```
   http://[PI_IP_ADDRESS]:5000
   ```

#### Remote Access via Tailscale

For secure remote access to the API backend:

1. **Install Tailscale on Raspberry Pi** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh
   sudo tailscale up
   ```

2. **Install Tailscale on your client device** (laptop, phone, etc.)

3. **Access the API through Tailscale:**
   ```
   https://edge-traffic-monitoring.taild46447.ts.net/api

#### Interpreting the Data

**Understanding Confidence Levels:**

Each vehicle detection includes a confidence score:
- **90-100%** = Very confident ‚úÖ (Highly reliable classification)
- **75-89%** = Confident ‚ö†Ô∏è (Generally reliable)
- **60-74%** = Somewhat confident ‚ÑπÔ∏è (Less reliable, verify if important)
- **Below 60%** = Low confidence ‚ùå (May be inaccurate)

**Speed Accuracy:**

- Radar provides highly accurate speed measurements (¬±1 mph)
- Speed is measured continuously while vehicle is in detection zone
- Reported speed is the average during detection period

**Vehicle Type Classification:**

- AI classification happens on the IMX500 camera's NPU
- Classification accuracy depends on:
  - Lighting conditions (better in daylight)
  - Vehicle distance (best at 20-100 feet)
  - Angle of view (front/rear views work best)
  - Weather conditions (clear weather is best)

## 6. FAQ

### 6.1 General Questions

**Q: What types of vehicles can the system detect?**

A: The AI camera can detect and classify cars, trucks, motorcycles, and buses. Detection accuracy is highest for standard passenger vehicles (85-95%) and decreases slightly for unusual vehicle types or motorcycles due to their smaller size.

**Q: How accurate is the speed measurement?**

A: The OPS243-C radar sensor provides ¬±2 mph accuracy for vehicles traveling up to 60 mph under normal conditions. Accuracy may decrease in adverse weather or with very small vehicles (motorcycles, bicycles).

**Q: Can the system work in all weather conditions?**

A: Yes, the system is designed for outdoor use with an IP65-rated enclosure. The radar sensor works reliably in all weather conditions including rain, snow, and fog. Camera-based AI classification may have reduced accuracy in very poor visibility but the radar will continue to detect vehicles and measure speed.

**Q: How much data storage is required?**

A: With default settings, the system generates approximately 1-2 GB of data per day, including logs, detection events, and periodic image captures. The recommended 1TB external SSD provides several months to over a year of storage, depending on traffic volume and retention settings.

**Q: Is the system compliant with privacy regulations?**

A: Yes. All AI processing occurs on the IMX500 camera sensor itself, and the system does not store continuous video footage by default. Only metadata (timestamps, vehicle types, speeds) is logged. The system can be configured to capture snapshots for verification purposes, with appropriate retention policies to comply with local privacy laws.

**Q: Can I integrate this system with existing traffic management systems?**

A: Yes. The system provides REST and WebSocket APIs that can be integrated with external traffic management platforms. See the Technical Design Document for API specifications and integration examples.

### 6.2 Technical Questions

**Q: What network connectivity is required?**

A: The system requires an internet connection for remote access via Tailscale VPN and GitHub Pages dashboard access. The API backend runs locally on the Raspberry Pi but is accessed remotely through Tailscale. Minimum bandwidth requirement is 1 Mbps. For optimal performance, 5-10 Mbps is recommended, especially if the system is capturing and storing snapshots.

**Q: Can I access the system remotely?**

A: Yes. The system supports secure remote access using Tailscale, a mesh VPN that creates a private network between your devices. Tailscale allows you to SSH or access the dashboard from anywhere, as if you were on the same local network. See the Implementation & Deployment Guide for setup instructions.

**Q: How do I connect to the Raspberry Pi using Tailscale?**

A: The system uses Tailscale for secure remote access. After installing Tailscale on both your Raspberry Pi and your client device (laptop/desktop), you can access the system:

**Option 1: Web Dashboard (Recommended)**
```
https://gcu-merk.github.io/CST_590_Computer_Science_Capstone_Project/
```
The GitHub Pages dashboard will automatically connect to your Tailscale-protected API.

**Option 2: Direct API Access**
```bash
# SSH to Raspberry Pi
ssh merk@edge-traffic-monitoring.taild46447.ts.net

# Or access API directly
https://edge-traffic-monitoring.taild46447.ts.net/api
```

Ensure Tailscale is running and connected on both devices. For more details, see the Implementation & Deployment Guide.

**Q: How do I calibrate the speed measurement?**

A: The OPS243-C radar sensor is factory-calibrated and typically requires no additional calibration. However, you can verify accuracy by comparing readings with a GPS speedometer or radar gun. If you notice consistent offsets, check the radar orientation and mounting. Contact support if recalibration is needed.

**Q: What happens if the power goes out?**

A: The system will automatically resume normal operation when power is restored. All services are configured to start on boot. If you have a UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply), the Raspberry Pi can continue operating for several hours during outages, depending on UPS capacity.

**Q: How do I back up my data?**

A: You can back up data using several methods:

1. **Manual backup:**
   ```bash
   # Copy database to backup location
   cp /mnt/storage/traffic.db /path/to/backup/
   ```

2. **Automated backup script:**
   ```bash
   # Run backup script (if configured)
   ./scripts/backup_data.sh
   ```

3. **Cloud synchronization:** Enable cloud sync in settings to automatically upload data to cloud storage.

**Q: Can I adjust detection sensitivity or thresholds?**

A: Yes, detection thresholds and sensitivity can be adjusted in the configuration files. This allows you to fine-tune the system for your specific deployment:

- **AI Confidence Threshold:** Minimum confidence score for vehicle classification (default: 0.70)
- **Speed Threshold:** Minimum/maximum speed for logging (e.g., ignore stationary objects)
- **ROI (Region of Interest):** Define specific areas of the camera frame to monitor

See the Technical Design Document for detailed configuration parameters.

**Q: How many vehicles can the system handle simultaneously?**

A: The system can reliably process 3-5 vehicles simultaneously in the camera's field of view. The IMX500's on-chip AI can handle multiple detections in a single frame, and the radar can track multiple targets. Performance depends on vehicle spacing and speed.
