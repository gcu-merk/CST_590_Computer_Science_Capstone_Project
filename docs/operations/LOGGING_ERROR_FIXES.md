# Radar Service Logging Error Fixes

**Last Updated:** September 26, 2025 at 2:15 PM

## Issue Summary
The radar service was generating spurious "Error in radar monitoring loop" messages after successful vehicle detections. These were caused by Redis publishing errors bubbling up to the main monitoring loop exception handler.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Primary Issue**: Redis publishing failures after successful vehicle detections
2. **Secondary Issue**: Generic exception handler in monitoring loop caught ALL exceptions
3. **Impact**: Legitimate vehicle detections appeared as errors in logs

## Fixes Applied (v2.1.2)

### 1. Enhanced Exception Handling Structure
```python
# Before: Single catch-all exception handler
except Exception as e:
    self.logger.log_error(
        error_type="radar_loop_error",
        message="Error in radar monitoring loop"
    )

# After: Granular exception handling
try:
    # Data processing with isolated error handling
    self._process_radar_data_enhanced(line)
except Exception as data_error:
    # Handle data processing errors separately
    self.logger.log_error(
        error_type="radar_data_processing_error",
        message="Error processing radar data (continuing monitoring)"
    )
```

### 2. Isolated Redis Error Handling
- Redis publishing errors are caught and logged separately
- Vehicle detections still succeed even if Redis fails
- Prevents Redis connectivity issues from appearing as loop errors

### 3. Top-Level Data Processing Protection
- Added comprehensive exception handler in `_process_radar_data_enhanced()`
- Prevents any data processing exception from bubbling to monitoring loop
- Maintains service stability during edge cases

### 4. Stats Logging Protection
- Isolated statistics logging errors to prevent loop interruption
- Ensures periodic stats failures don't crash monitoring

## Error Types Now Distinguished

| Error Type | Description | Impact |
|------------|-------------|---------|
| `radar_data_processing_error` | Issues parsing/processing radar data | Non-critical, monitoring continues |
| `redis_publish_error` | Redis connectivity/publishing issues | Vehicle still detected, just not published |
| `stats_logging_error` | Periodic statistics logging failure | Monitoring continues normally |
| `radar_loop_critical_error` | Actual monitoring loop failures | Critical, requires investigation |

## Verification Steps

1. **Deploy v2.1.2** ‚úÖ (Committed and pushed)
2. **Monitor for vehicle detections** - Should see clean logs like:
   ```
   üöó Vehicle detected: 25.3 mph
   ```
3. **Verify no spurious errors** - Should NOT see:
   ```
   ‚ùå Error in radar monitoring loop
   ```

## CI/CD Integration
- Version bumped to 2.1.2
- Automatic deployment via GitHub Actions
- Enhanced error handling will be active on next container restart

## Future Prevention
- Error types are now granular and descriptive
- Redis issues won't mask actual system problems  
- Vehicle detection functionality is protected from downstream failures
- Clear separation between critical vs non-critical errors

## Testing Recommendation
After deployment, wait for real vehicle detections and verify:
- Clean vehicle detection logs without error messages
- Proper correlation IDs in detection events
- No "Error in radar monitoring loop" messages for successful detections
