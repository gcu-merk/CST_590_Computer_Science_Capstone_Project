# Quick Reference: Centralized Logging Implementation

## 🚀 2-Hour MVP Implementation Plan

### Current Status: Multi-Service Logging Challenges
Your system has **20+ independent logging configurations** across:
- Radar Service (OPS243-C)
- Camera Service (IMX500 AI) 
- Weather Service (DHT22 + API)
- Vehicle Consolidator
- Database Persistence
- API Gateway

**Problems:**
- Cannot trace vehicle detection from radar → consolidator → API
- Inconsistent log formats
- No performance metrics
- Scattered error handling

## ⏱️ Phase 1: Core Integration (2 hours)

### Step 1: Radar Service Enhancement (45 minutes)

**File:** `radar_service.py` 

**Current Code:**
```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.info("Vehicle detected")
```

**Enhanced Code:**
```python
from edge_processing.shared_logging import get_radar_logger, CorrelationContext

service_logger = get_radar_logger()
logger = service_logger.get_logger()

with CorrelationContext(service_logger) as correlation_id:
    logger.info("🚛 Vehicle detected: 25.3 mph", extra={
        'event_type': 'vehicle_detection',
        'speed_mph': 25.3,
        'correlation_id': correlation_id
    })
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Correlation tracking across services
- ✅ Structured vehicle detection logs
- ✅ Performance timing automatically included

### Step 2: Consolidator Service Enhancement (45 minutes)

**File:** `vehicle_consolidator_service.py`

**Add correlation handling:**
```python
def process_radar_event(self, radar_data):
    # Extract correlation ID from radar data
    correlation_id = radar_data.get('correlation_id')
    
    if correlation_id:
        self.service_logger.set_correlation_id(correlation_id)
    
    # Now all logs will include the same correlation ID
    self.logger.info("📊 Processing vehicle data", extra={
        'event_type': 'data_consolidation',
        'sources': ['radar', 'weather', 'sensors']
    })
```

**Result:** Full request tracking from radar detection through consolidation

### Step 3: Health Monitoring Setup (30 minutes)

**Create health endpoint:**
```python
def get_system_health():
    return {
        'radar_service': radar_service.get_health_status(),
        'consolidator': consolidator.get_health_status(),
        'redis_status': redis_client.ping(),
        'detection_rate': get_hourly_detection_rate()
    }
```

## 📊 Immediate Results After 2-Hour Implementation

### Before vs After Comparison

#### **Before (Current)**
```
INFO - Vehicle detected
INFO - Processing data
ERROR - Connection failed
```

#### **After (Enhanced)**  
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-09-24T14:30:45",
  "service": "radar_service", 
  "correlation_id": "abc12345",
  "event_type": "vehicle_detection",
  "message": "🚛 Vehicle detected: 25.3 mph",
  "speed_mph": 25.3,
  "processing_time_ms": 45.2
}

{
  "timestamp": "2025-09-24T14:30:45", 
  "service": "vehicle_consolidator",
  "correlation_id": "abc12345", 
  "event_type": "data_consolidation",
  "message": "📊 Processing vehicle data",
  "sources": ["radar", "weather", "sensors"]
}
```

### Debugging Capabilities

**Track complete vehicle detection flow:**
```bash
# Find all events for specific vehicle detection
grep "abc12345" /mnt/storage/logs/applications/*.log

# Results show complete flow:
# radar_service → vehicle_consolidator → api_gateway
```

**Performance analysis:**
```bash
# Find slowest operations  
grep "processing_time_ms" *.log | sort -k6 -nr

# Identify bottlenecks in real-time
```

## 💡 Quick Commands for Implementation

### Start Implementation
```bash
# 1. Files are already created in your repo
# 2. Integrate radar service (45 min)
# 3. Integrate consolidator (45 min)  
# 4. Test correlation tracking (30 min)
```

### Verify Results
```bash
# Watch real-time correlation
tail -f /mnt/storage/logs/applications/*.log | grep correlation_id

# Check performance metrics
grep "processing_time_ms" /mnt/storage/logs/applications/*.log
```

### Test Vehicle Detection Flow
```bash
# Trigger radar detection (truck passes)
# Watch logs for correlation ID flow:
# radar_service → vehicle_consolidator → [other services]
```

**Ready to start the 2-hour implementation?** The shared logging infrastructure is already created and documented. We just need to integrate it into your radar and consolidator services for immediate debugging benefits.
